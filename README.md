Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jacksen, an enthusiastic student and emerging front-end developer. My journey in this dynamic field is marked by a strong commitment to learning and a passion for creating engaging, user-friendly web interfaces. With proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've recently started harnessing the capabilities of React to add more dynamic features to my projects.

Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by exploring TypeScript, an exciting language that brings static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

I'm particularly thrilled about the prospect of transitioning into a programming career, where I can apply my skills and contribute to meaningful projects. I'm open to collaboration and eager to be part of innovative and challenging projects, where I can learn, grow, and make a significant impact.
